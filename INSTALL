How to Install and operate Growme

1. Open a Superfeedr account : http://superfeedr.com/subscriber
This is currently using the regular superfeedr accounts and will change in the future. Please ignore the "messy" look. It was built for developers who would use superfeedr.
Also, you may receive warnings in the future about credits consumption... etc. Ignore these and please email me when that happens so I'll grant more credits


2. Install the extension.
Unzip the zip file.
Launch Chrome.
On the right of the url bar, click on the wrench icon.
Select "Tools", and then "Extensions"
Click on "Load unpacked Extension".

3. Configure
You should be taken to the settings page of the extension.
First, enter the login and password you chose when creating your superfeedr account.
Please ignore the plugins at first.

You can now use browse to regular web pages. You will see the bookmark on any page you browse. If the last line of it isn't "Superfeedr is connected", please restart Chrome, or fix your credentials in the settings.

The bookmark has the following features :
 - Subscribe : it helps you subscribe to web pages that you like. If there is an RSS feed on the page, it will use it. If there are multiple, it will allow you to chose. If there is now, you will still be able to enter a URL by hand.
 - Inbox : it is where all your messages will end up. 
 - Like : it will allow a message to your inbox when you're on a page that you like.
 
The inbox allows you to see the messages you've received, the unread, and the ones you starred.

Once you've got a small understand of how things work, I suggest you go back to the settings (thru inbox for example), and select one of the plugins.
When you click one, it will "sync" all your subscriptions on that service, back into the extension. You should get messages to indicate successful subscriptions. 
Also, this plugin "hijacks" the subscribe/follow buttons so that when you subscribe to more feeds/sites, they will be added to growme automatically.
Right now, the supported plugins are Google Reader and Tumblr, but I want to add any site that offers a subscription mechanism and for which we can use feeds as the transport (Flickr, Posterous, Gowalla, Pinboard, Github... etc.)
I will also release this client as OSS, so I can hope people can help improve it soon as well.

4. Notes
- The interface is ugly. I will make it better and I will need to work with some designers too.
- There is no social part just yet:
 * IM client
 * Link sharing
- This is slow-ish sometimes, as it uses an old "system" to communicate to the browser. I have a contractor working on a websockets version of this
- I want to work on the "web" part of this too. I will provide a web app for user registration and such.
- I will add support for notifications that are ads as well to monetize quickly.
- I also want to add the ability to tag and comment on messages... but it's not there yet.

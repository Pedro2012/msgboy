h2. Publishers

Msgboy increases loyalty and engagement of your users and visitors. They can follow pages on your site so that when you add content, they're notified. 
Here are a few tips and tricks to make it easier for people to subscribe.

1. Point to a feed that includes updates in each page of your site.
    * Put a single feed per page, corresponding to the content on that page.
    * Make sure you use a meaningful <code>title</code> in the <code>link</code> element. Do not include RSS, or Feed, but maybe just the title of the content. "Julien's Blog" is a good example. "RSS feed" is not, as it's not meaningful for users.
    
2. Setup your feeds correctly.
    * Make sure your feed is correctly formatted, valid and easy to parse (limit to 10 entries, use unique identifiers for each entry, correctly formatted dates... etc)
    * Implement PubSubHubbub for realtime notifications (users are notified as soon as you update the content). "Superfeedr":http://superfeedr.com/publisher can help.

3. Tricks
    * Listen to msgboy triggered events to keep track of your visitors who use msgboy, or who subscribe to your feeds. Listen to the events <code>msgboy-bookmark-loaded</code> and <code>msgboy-subscribed</code> on the body.
